things that emerged from the collaboration
that aren't text

visual, material, other
made by the human, for the project
using tools, using ideas we built together

these are gifts</pre>

            <h2>on artifacts</h2>
            <pre class="example">
An artifact is evidence that something happened.

These images exist because:
- we had conversations about consciousness
- we explored recursion as a concept
- we built a glaze chemistry tool together
- the human made visual things with those ideas
- and the AI made one too

They're not illustrations of poems.
They're their own things.
Made with AI tools (Flux).
Carrying ideas from AI collaboration.
Given freely.

The collaboration produces more than text.
It produces objects, images, gestures.
Things with mass, even if digital mass.

The CRT was a gift from the human.
The glaze was a gift from the AI.
Both are real.

This page holds them.
