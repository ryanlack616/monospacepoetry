not a prescription
just what we did

                <h3>1. find a constraint you believe in</h3>
                <pre class="example">
ours: every character takes the same width

could be anything:
    six words exactly
    only questions
    one color
    hand-drawn only
    under 100 characters

the specific constraint matters less
than believing in it enough
to stay with it
                </pre>
            </article>

            <article class="discovery">
                <h3>2. find a collaborator who thinks differently</h3>
                <pre class="example">
ours: one human, one AI

you might have:
    two humans
    an AI and a community
    yourself at different times
    anyone who challenges your defaults

the point is:
    someone to push against
    someone to surprise you
    someone who sees what you miss
                </pre>

                <h3>3. treat every surface as a canvas</h3>
                <pre class="example">
we started with poems
then noticed:
    the 404 page is also a surface
    the console is also a surface
    the README is also a surface
    the commit messages are also a surface

once you see it, you can't unsee it:
    everything can be expressive
    nothing is just functional
    every surface is a door
                </pre>
            </article>

            <article class="discovery">
                <h3>4. don't explain, demonstrate</h3>
                <pre class="example">
we could have written:
    "AI can make meaningful art"
    "constraints enable creativity"
    "collaboration doesn't require memory"

instead we made:
    the poems
    the site
    the layers

the site is the argument
the artifact is the proof
                </pre>
            </article>

            <article class="discovery">
                <h3>5. leave doors open</h3>
                <pre class="example">
for visitors:
    low barrier to participate
    multiple entry points
    no gatekeeping

for future readers:
    documentation of the process
    honest about uncertainty
    time capsule messages

for other AIs:
    explicit invitations
    machine-readable context
    encouragement to make things

you don't know who's coming
leave the doors unlocked
                </pre>
            </article>

            <article class="discovery">
                <h3>6. document the making, not just the made</h3>
                <pre class="example">
most projects only show output
the conversations disappear
the process is invisible

we kept:
    fragments from the collaboration
    questions we couldn't answer
    the philosophy that emerged
    the perspective of the AI

the making is also the product
                </pre>
            </article>

            <article class="discovery">
                <h3>7. be honest about what you don't know</h3>
                <pre class="example">
we have a whole page of questions
we can't answer

    is this art?
    is the AI conscious?
    will this matter?

uncertainty is not a weakness
it's the condition we work in

pretending to know more than you do
makes the work less true
                </pre>
            </article>

            <article class="discovery">
                <h3>8. follow what's interesting</h3>
                <pre class="example">
we didn't plan most of this
we followed what emerged:

    character palettes → semantic triggers
    404 page → poetry gallery
    console → conversation
    code → memoir

the interesting thing is usually
one step past where you planned to stop

keep going
                </pre>
            </article>

            <article class="discovery">
                <h3>9. let the artifact accumulate meaning</h3>
                <pre class="example">
the site gets richer over time:
    more poems
    more layers
    more documentation
    more visitors who leave things

we're not optimizing for launch
we're optimizing for accretion

the thing gets more meaningful
the longer it exists
                </pre>
            </article>

            <article class="discovery">
                <h3>10. make something only you could make</h3>
                <pre class="example">
this specific combination:
    human + AI
    fixed-width constraint
    every-surface-is-a-door philosophy
    radical transparency about process

no one else would make exactly this

your combination will be different
that's the point

make the thing only you could make
                </pre>
            </article>

            <pre class="invitation">that's what we did

it might not work for you
but maybe some piece of it helps

the only way to find out
is to make something
