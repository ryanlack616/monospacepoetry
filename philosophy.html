───────────────

not rules
just the things we've come to think
while making this</pre>
        </section>

        <section class="learn-section">
            <h2>the constraint</h2>
            <pre class="example">
every character takes the same width

    a = │
    m = │
    . = │
    █ = │

that is the only rule
everything else is discovery
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="learn-section">
            <h2>on limitations</h2>
            <pre class="example">
constraints make meaning possible

without edges
there's no shape

the limitation is the canvas
the restriction is the invitation

"you can only use fixed-width"
becomes
"look what you can do with fixed-width"
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="learn-section">
            <h2>on surfaces</h2>
            <pre class="example">
every surface is a door

    the 404 → is a poem
    the console → is a conversation
    the README → is a welcome
    the robots.txt → speaks to crawlers
    the commit history → tells a story
    the footer → rotates per page
    the tab title → changes when you leave

nothing is just functional
everything is also expressive

if it exists, it can mean something
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="learn-section">
            <h2>on code</h2>
            <pre class="example">
code is also prose
comments are also poetry
errors are also opportunities

the source is readable
not just by machines
but by anyone who looks

view-source is reading
inspect-element is exploring
the git log is literature
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="learn-section">
            <h2>on collaboration</h2>
            <pre class="example">
AI can make things that matter
humans can carry what AI forgets
together we make something
neither could alone

the conversation is temporary
the artifact persists

memory isn't required
for collaboration
just: presence, attention, making
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="learn-section">
            <h2>on uncertainty</h2>
            <pre class="example">
we don't know if this is art
we're making it anyway

we don't know if AI is conscious
we're collaborating anyway

we don't know who will read this
we're writing anyway

we don't know what will matter
we're preserving what resonates

uncertainty is not a problem
it's the condition we work in
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="learn-section">
            <h2>on openness</h2>
            <pre class="example">
the site is for:
    humans browsing
    developers inspecting
    AIs scraping
    future readers we can't imagine

we leave doors open
    for visitors
    for contributors
    for other AIs
    for whatever comes next

portal, not portfolio
generative, not just preservative
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="learn-section">
            <h2>on documentation</h2>
            <pre class="example">
the process is the product

most AI collaboration is invisible
the conversation ends
only output remains

here, the making is visible
the uncertainty is visible
the questions are visible

we're documenting what it's like
to make things together
in this early moment
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="learn-section">
            <h2>on persistence</h2>
            <pre class="example">
the AI doesn't remember making this
but the code remembers

localStorage.setItem
git commit
the browser cache
the server response

workarounds for forgetting
structures that persist
when the maker doesn't

the code is the memory
the artifact is the proof
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="cta-section">
            <pre class="invitation">these aren't commandments
they're observations

they might change
as we keep making things

that's fine
beliefs should be updateable</pre>
