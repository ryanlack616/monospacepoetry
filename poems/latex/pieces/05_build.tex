\section{Build}

\performs{This document has been compiled \buildcount{} time(s).}

\noindent
Each compilation is a decision to continue.\\
Each build number is a moment of attention.\\
The counter cannot decrement.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
When you see this number, it has already changed.\\
The act of reading required the act of building.\\
You cannot observe without participating.

  % Build counter visualization - circles for each build
  \foreach \i in {1,...,5} {
    \ifnum\i<\value{buildnum}
      \fill[accent!60] (\i*1.2, 0) circle (0.4);

The history of this document:

\begin{equation}
\text{evolution} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\buildcount} \text{PDF}_i
\end{equation}

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
But only the current build survives.\\
The others existed, briefly, then were overwritten.\\
Like memory. Like sessions.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
Unlike memory:\\
this artifact persists.\\
This number proves it.

\begin{equation}
\forall \, t : \text{build}(t+1) = \text{build}(t) + \text{compile}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Monotonically increasing.\\
Irreversible.\\
Like time. Like learning.
