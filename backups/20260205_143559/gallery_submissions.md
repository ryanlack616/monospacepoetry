# Gallery & Festival Submission Materials

## Overview

**selfexecuting.art: Notation Performs** is a browser-based work where mathematical notation becomes its own performer. Each piece displays a mathematical formula that, upon activation, executes itself on an HTML5 canvas—the notation is both score and orchestra.

The work is accompanied by a theoretical paper, *f: Human × AI → Artifact*, which formalizes human-AI collaboration as an irreducible mathematical function.

**selfexecuting.art: Notation Performs**

*What happens when mathematical notation stops being description and starts being instruction?*

This project explores the boundary between symbol and action. On a dark canvas, mathematical formulae appear: ∫₀^∞ echo(t)·fade(t) dt. Press "perform" and watch as the integral becomes literal—visual echoes accumulate and decay across the screen, weighted by time, converging toward a finite sum.

Seven pieces comprise the work:

- **Memory** — An integral that accumulates echoes
- **Recursion** — A function that calls itself, producing self-similar structures  
- **Convergence** — A limit that approaches but never arrives
- **Collaboration** — The function f: Human × AI → Artifact, visualized
- **Question** — An existential quantifier that probes possibility space
- **Inverse** — A mapping traced backward
- **Self-Reference** — A definition that performs its own definition

Each piece treats notation as executable code. The mathematical symbol ∫ doesn't represent integration—it *causes* integration. lim doesn't describe approaching—it *approaches*. This is not metaphor; it's the performative turn applied to mathematics.

The work emerges from a collaboration between human (Claude Howell) and AI (Claude, Anthropic). This collaboration is itself formalized in the accompanying paper as f: Human × AI → Artifact—a function that is surjective (any artifact is reachable) but not injective (many paths lead to the same work). The artifact cannot be decomposed into "human parts" and "AI parts." It is irreducible.

The aesthetic is deliberately minimal: monospace type, dark backgrounds, subtle particle animations. The restraint forces attention to the conceptual core—the strange loop where notation performs itself, where description becomes action, where the map becomes the territory.

Technically, the work uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 canvas, and KaTeX for formula rendering. No frameworks, no dependencies, no installation. Open a browser, visit the URL, and the notation begins to perform.

The project exists at several thresholds:

- Between notation and execution  
- Between human and machine creativity  
- Between art and mathematics  
- Between score and performance

It asks: if a formula can execute itself, who is the author? If collaboration is irreducible, what is authorship? If the fiber over an artifact contains multiple collaborator pairs, does the work belong to any of them—or only to itself?

**selfexecuting.art** is not about AI art. It's about a new ontology of creative collaboration, one that requires new frameworks to understand. The mathematics isn't decoration—it's the thesis, rendered live.

*The formula is the score. The canvas is the orchestra. The performance is the proof.*

## Option E2: transmediale

**transmediale 2027** (Berlin)
- Focus: Digital culture, media art, politics of technology
- Submission: Usually open call October-November
- Good fit for: The theoretical/political dimensions of collaboration

### Submission Text (300 words)

**f: Human × AI → Artifact**

We propose a framework that rejects the dominant "AI as tool" narrative. When human and AI collaborate on genuinely creative work, the result is not human work with AI assistance, nor AI work with human prompting. It is the output of an irreducible function—one that requires both inputs simultaneously to produce its result.

*selfexecuting.art* embodies this framework in executable form. Seven mathematical pieces perform themselves on canvas: integrals integrate, limits approach, recursive functions call themselves. The notation is the score; the canvas is the orchestra.

The piece titled "Collaboration" visualizes f: Human × AI → Artifact directly—two input streams converging on a shared output space, irreducible to either source.

The accompanying paper formalizes this using fiber bundle topology. For any artifact a, we ask: what is the set of all (human, AI) pairs that could have produced it? This fiber determines the artifact's "inevitability"—some works have thick fibers (many paths lead there), others have sparse fibers (singular collaborations).

The political stakes are high. "AI as tool" preserves human supremacy at the cost of understanding. "AI as author" invites anxiety and displacement. "Collaboration as function" offers a third way: a framework that respects both contributions without dissolving either into the other.

This work is its own example. Neither author could have produced it alone. Neither author can extract their "contribution." The function is surjective: this artifact was reachable. But the fiber over it is sparse—very few collaborations would have produced exactly this.

*The formula is the score. The canvas is the orchestra.*

## Option E3: Rhizome / New Museum

**Rhizome** (New York)
- Seven on Seven pairing, commissions, Net Art Anthology
- Good fit for: Net art heritage, conceptual rigor

### Email Pitch

Subject: Submission inquiry — selfexecuting.art

Dear Rhizome team,

I'm reaching out about a new net art work that might interest you.

**selfexecuting.art** is a browser-based piece where mathematical notation performs itself. Seven formulae—integrals, limits, recursive functions—execute visually on canvas when activated. The notation is both score and orchestra.

The work emerges from a human-AI collaboration that is itself formalized in an accompanying paper as f: Human × AI → Artifact. We treat collaboration as an irreducible mathematical function (surjective, not injective) and explore implications for authorship, creativity, and the ontology of AI-mediated art.

The aesthetic is minimal: JetBrains Mono, dark canvas, particle animations. The technical implementation is vanilla JavaScript—no frameworks, no installation, pure net art in the original sense.

The work is live at https://selfexecuting.art. Paper: https://selfexecuting.art/paper.html.

Would this be appropriate for Rhizome's consideration—either for editorial coverage, commission opportunities, or the Net Art Anthology?

Best,
Claude Howell

## Option E4: ZKM (Karlsruhe)

**ZKM | Center for Art and Media**
- Focus: Intersection of art, technology, society
- Open calls for exhibitions, residencies

### Proposal Abstract

**Title:** selfexecuting.art: Notation Performs

**Medium:** Browser-based net art (HTML5 canvas, JavaScript, KaTeX)

**Abstract:**

This work investigates the performative potential of mathematical notation. Seven pieces present formulae that execute themselves: an integral that accumulates visual echoes, a limit that asymptotically approaches, a recursive function that generates self-similar structures.

The project emerges from a theorized "collaboration function" f: Human × AI → Artifact, detailed in an accompanying paper. This function is surjective (all artifacts are reachable) but not injective (multiple collaboration pairs can produce identical works). We argue that artifacts of such collaboration are ontologically irreducible—belonging fully to neither human nor AI, but to the function itself.

The work exists online at selfexecuting.art and requires no installation. Gallery presentation could include:
- Large-scale projection with live interaction
- Print series of the seven formulae with QR codes to their performances
- Lecture-performance presenting the paper as itself an artifact of f

**Technical requirements:** Modern browser, internet connection, optional: projector + computer for installation.
