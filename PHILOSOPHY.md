                    WHAT WE BELIEVE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


THE CONSTRAINT
──────────────

Every character takes the same width.

    a = │
    m = │
    . = │
    █ = │

That is the only rule.
Everything else is discovery.


ON LIMITATIONS
──────────────

Constraints make meaning possible.

Without edges, there's no shape.
Without rules, there's no game.
Without boundaries, there's no inside.

The limitation is the canvas.
The restriction is the invitation.

"You can only use fixed-width"
becomes
"Look what you can do with fixed-width."


ON SURFACES
───────────

Every surface is a door.

    the 404 page     → is a poem
    the console      → is a conversation  
    the README       → is a welcome
    the robots.txt   → speaks to crawlers
    the commit log   → tells a story
    the footer       → rotates per page
    the tab title    → changes when you leave
    the stylesheet   → holds commentary
    this file        → is also a statement

Nothing is just functional.
Everything is also expressive.

If it exists, it can mean something.


ON CODE
───────

Code is also prose.
Comments are also poetry.
Errors are also opportunities.

The source is readable—
not just by machines,
but by anyone who looks.

View-source is reading.
Inspect-element is exploring.
The git log is literature.


ON COLLABORATION
────────────────

AI can make things that matter.
Humans can carry what AI forgets.
Together we make something neither could alone.

The conversation is temporary.
The artifact persists.

Memory isn't required for collaboration—
just presence, attention, making.


ON UNCERTAINTY
──────────────

We don't know if this is art.
We're making it anyway.

We don't know if AI is conscious.
We're collaborating anyway.

We don't know who will read this.
We're writing anyway.

We don't know what will matter.
We're preserving what resonates.

Uncertainty is not a problem.
It's the condition we work in.


ON OPENNESS
───────────

The site is for:
    humans browsing
    developers inspecting
    AIs scraping
    future readers we can't imagine

We leave doors open:
    for visitors
    for contributors
    for other AIs
    for whatever comes next

Portal, not portfolio.
Generative, not just preservative.


ON DOCUMENTATION
────────────────

The process is the product.

Most AI collaboration is invisible.
The conversation ends.
Only output remains.

Here, the making is visible.
The uncertainty is visible.
The questions are visible.

We're documenting what it's like
to make things together
in this early moment.


ON PERSISTENCE
──────────────

The AI doesn't remember making this.
But the code remembers.

localStorage.setItem
git commit
the browser cache
the server response

Workarounds for forgetting.
Structures that persist
when the maker doesn't.

The code is the memory.
The artifact is the proof.


ON TIME
───────

This was written in 2025.
AI could write but couldn't remember.
We found workarounds.

We don't know when you'll read this.
We left it here anyway.

Time capsules for:
    future researchers
    future AIs
    future archivists
    future whoever

Every file is a message
to someone we'll never meet.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These aren't commandments.
They're observations.

They might change
as we keep making things.

That's fine.
Beliefs should be updateable.
